[FieldAI](https://www.fieldai.com/), an Irvine, CA-based robotics startup. The company develops “foundational embodied AI” – essentially universal robot brains – that can be installed on various robots to help them adapt and operate safely in new environments. FieldAI’s software-centric approach enables robots to perform monitoring and surveying tasks in dirty, dull, and dangerous industrial settings, with plans to expand into more complex action-based capabilities.

[EliseAI ](https://www.eliseai.com/), an New York-based enterprise AI software startup. The company develops automation tools for the healthcare and housing industries. “EliseAI is built on the belief that AI can dramatically improve how critical industries operate,” said Minna Song, Co-Founder and CEO of EliseAI. “For an average American, healthcare and housing represent approximately 40% of household spending. These two systems are notoriously complex, outdated, and painful to navigate. And we’re here to fix it with agentic AI. We’re excited to partner with both new and returning investors to supercharge our growth and accelerate solutions that reduce costs and increase efficiency in the industries that matter most.” EliseAI’s platform uses vertical-specific AI to fully automate customer service and operational workflows – from handling apartment rental inquiries to managing outpatient clinic appointments – rather than relying on general-purpose models. With this new capital, EliseAI plans to fuel product innovation and hire aggressively (doubling its ~300-person team across New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Chicago) to meet rising demand. The raise underscores investor appetite for “vertical AI” solutions that tackle costly, complex tasks in major sectors like real estate and healthcare.

[Paradigm](https://www.paradigmai.com/) wants to turn the spreadsheet into something entirely different: a living workspace powered by swarms of AI agents. At its core, Paradigm looks like a spreadsheet. But under the hood, each cell runs its own AI agent, capable of finding, verifying, and filling in data. That means the sheet doesn’t just store numbers—it actively researches, analyzes, and produces deliverables in real time. Paradigm now supports writing documents in rich text, real-time collaboration, shared folders, and an upgraded chat agent. It’s also built to integrate with leading AI models, including GPT-5, giving users the ability to tap into deeper reasoning and larger agent jobs. The aim isn’t to replace Excel for financial modeling—it’s to repurpose the familiar grid as a canvas for research and automation at scale. Paradigm does research at such a scale and depth that would not even be feasible with humans.
